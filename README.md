## Description

I am Oskar Gmerek, and oskargmerek.com serves as my professional online presence. On this website, you will presently discover key information about my background, updates on the projects I am involved in, and ways to get in touch with me. Additionally, I provide valuable insights into the services and products I utilize and endorse, updates on my investment ventures, and thought-provoking articles on diverse subjects where I wish to convey my perspectives. Furthermore, you are welcome to peruse my personal notes on topics that pique my interest.

## Motivation

I have not been entirely satisfied with my professional career, despite being self-employed for a long time, which many might consider a success. However, I work in an industry that I find dull and, unfortunately, tainted with characteristics I do not want to associate myself with.

In 2023, I finally decided to change industries. I am gradually closing down the companies I manage in a way that minimizes the impact on my employees. I am participating in the first Bootcamp for programmers organized by HyperionDev. I set goals for myself and strive to achieve them, all in order to attract the attention of recruiters and talent seekers in the IT industry. However, I am aware that without a portfolio, I will not catch anyone's attention. Thus, the idea of creating a personal website was born.

## Problem

Lack of a professional online presence, which I believe is slightly hypocritical, considering I am pursuing a web developer position.

Absence of online projects that I can showcase and add to my CV.

No open-source projects that I can make public without violating any agreements.

No personal and convenient space for storing notes.

No place where I can collect materials, services, and products that interest me, divided into relevant categories.

Inability to demonstrate skills in project planning and management.

Inability to showcase skills using tools such as Git or GitHub.

## Solution

Initially, I thought it would be better to create several simple projects. However, I don't want to create applications that nobody will use. No one needs another TODO list or a newer, less functional calculator. Such projects can be found in most portfolios, and I don't want to be like the majority.

After a longer brainstorming session, I decided to focus on building my personal brand. All the aforementioned problems can be solved within the scope of a single personal website. Moreover, working on one project should eventually lead to a size closer to the commercial challenges I will soon face.
